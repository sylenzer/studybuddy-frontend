    <p>
      We understand that many parents want to help their children with homework,
      but math today—especially Common Core—can feel completely different from
      how you were taught. It’s not easy to step in and support your child when
      the strategies and expectations keep evolving.
    </p>
    <p>
      StudyBuddy+ is here to bridge that gap. It provides step-by-step
      explanations and visual support that both students <em>and</em> parents can
      follow. Whether you're brushing up or just trying to guide your child, this
      tool makes it easier to stay involved in their learning journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're still in the early stages and would love your feedback. If
      StudyBuddy+ has helped you or your child, please consider sharing a
      testimonial to help us improve and grow.

  <AnimatedAccordionItem value="students" title="🎓 Why should students use StudyBuddy+ instead of just looking up answers?">
    <p>
      Let’s be real—there are tons of apps and sites that will just hand you the
      answer. But StudyBuddy+ is different. It’s designed to help you
      <em>understand</em> the problem, not just skip past it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform is safe to use in the classroom and built with your teacher
      in mind. It gives you support without replacing your own learning. If you
      use StudyBuddy+ to cheat or bypass the learning process, your access may be
      canceled immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      We value honesty, growth, and transparency. StudyBuddy+ is here to help you
      feel more confident, not just complete your assignments faster. Use it the

      multiple ability levels, IEPs, and ever-changing pacing guides. It acts as
      a supportive classroom tool that gives students just-in-time help,
      adaptive hints, and visual breakdowns without giving away the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're working with struggling learners, advanced students, or
      managing large classes, StudyBuddy+ helps reinforce content in a way that’s
      consistent with instructional goals. It’s like having another co-teacher

    <p>
      Absolutely. StudyBuddy+ is built with academic integrity, accessibility,
      and classroom alignment at its core. Unlike many AI tools that simply
      generate answers, our platform focuses on guided practice, adaptive
      learning, and Common Core-aligned strategies that help—not hinder—the
      teaching process.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s safe for students, easy for teachers to integrate, and effective at
      closing gaps in real time. StudyBuddy+ also supports equity by giving every
      learner—regardless of their background or academic level—a structured,
      engaging way to make progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re in the early stages of growth and welcome school partnerships,
      educator testimonials, and community insight to ensure the platform keeps
      evolving in the right direction.
